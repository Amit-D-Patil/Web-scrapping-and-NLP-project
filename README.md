# Web-scrapping-and-NLP-project
This Python project extracts article text from URLs in an Excel file and performs NLP analysis to compute variables such as sentiment scores, readability measures, and word usage statistics. It uses web scraping libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy and NLP libraries such as NLTK or spaCy. The results are stored in a new Excel or CSV file.
